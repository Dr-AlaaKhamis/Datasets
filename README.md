This would be a very lengthy tutorial on [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API); this is the official API for reading data from OpenStreetMap servers and [all the online routing services and software use it](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Routing/online_routers) usually along side [Nominatim](https://github.com/osm-search/Nominatim) to do geo\[coding-decoding\]; translating addresses to/from (latitude - longitude).
